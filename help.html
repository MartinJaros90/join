            Welcome to the help page for <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>, your guide to using our kanban project
            management tool.
            Here, we'll
            provide an
            overview of what <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Join?</h3>
        <p>
            <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
            group of dedicated
            students as part
            of their web
            development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br><br>

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and
            maximize efficiency (or flow). <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> leverages the principles of kanban to
            help users manage
            their tasks and
            projects in
            an intuitive, visual interface. <br><br>

            It is important to note that <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> is designed as an educational exercise
            and is not intended
            for extensive
            business
            usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Exploring the Board</b> <br>
                When you log in to <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>, you'll find a default board. This board
                represents your project
                and contains
                four default
                lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Creating Contacts</b> <br>
                In <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
                the "Contacts"
                section, click on
                "New contact", and
                fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
                with the tasks
                on the board.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Adding Cards</b> <br>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click
                the "+" button
                under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name,
                description, due
                date, assignees, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Moving Cards</b> <br>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
                the card from
                one list to another.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Deleting Cards</b> <br>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will
                permanently
                remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.

                Remember that using <a class="join-link" href="#">Join</a> effectively requires consistent updates from

                to ensure the
                board reflects the
                current state of your project.
